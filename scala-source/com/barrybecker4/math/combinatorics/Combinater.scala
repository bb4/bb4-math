/**
  * Provides a way of iterating through all the combinations of a set of N integers.
  * For example, if N = 3, then the set of N integers is {0, 1, 2} and the all subsets are
  * {0}, {1}, {0, 1}, {2}, {2, 0}, {2, 1}, {2, 1, 0}
  * Note that the order of the elements in the subsets does not matter.
  * The implementation does not require memory for storing the permutations since  only one is produced at a time.
  * This algorithm will only work as long as the number of subsets is less than Long.MAX_VALUE.
  * In other words, N must be less than 60 since 2&caret;60 is close to Long.MAX_VALUE.
  * @param num the number of integer elements to permute.
